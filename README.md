# Explanation of Pie Chart Test


## Overview

The code in this project consists of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files that work together to create a pie chart displaying the number of installs by year. Additionally, it includes functionality to cancel out other years and view the number of installs for a specific year.

## HTML (index.html)

The HTML file contains the structure of the web page. It includes elements such as the canvas for the pie chart, the title, and the footer.

## CSS (styles.css)

The CSS file contains styles to customize the appearance of the web page. It includes global styles for body, canvas, headings, and footer, as well as animations for the slide-up effect and drop-in animation.

## JavaScript (script.js)

The JavaScript file contains the logic to fetch data from the 'pieChart.json' file and render a pie chart using the Chart.js library. It also includes functions to handle the animation of the pie chart and the slide-up effect for the canvas. Additionally, it provides functionality to cancel out other years and view the number of installs for a specific year.

## Interactive Features

- **Canceling out other years:** Users can click on a particular segment of the pie chart to cancel out other years and view the number of installs for that specific year only. This provides users with the ability to focus on a particular year's data and analyze it in isolation.

## Responsive Design

The CSS file includes media queries to make the web page responsive. Styles are adjusted for smaller screens such as tablets and mobile devices to ensure optimal display and readability.

## How to Use

To use this code, simply clone the repository and open the 'index.html' file in a web browser. Ensure that all files are in the same directory for the code to work properly.
