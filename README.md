# Sedibelo Technology Front-End Coding Challenge

This repository contains a front-end coding test that demonstrates the implementation of a pie chart, bar graph, and user search functionality using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Contents

1. **Pie Chart:** This coding test includes the implementation of a pie chart using JavaScript to visualize data in a circular statistical graphic. The pie chart represents data in slices, where each slice represents a category and its size represents the proportionate value.

2. **Bar Graph:** Additionally, this coding test includes the implementation of a bar graph using JavaScript to visualize data in a rectangular statistical graphic. The bar graph represents data using rectangular bars with lengths proportional to the values they represent.

3. **User Search:** The coding test also features a user search functionality implemented using JavaScript. Users can input keywords or phrases into a search bar, and the application dynamically filters and displays relevant user information based on the search query.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML:** Used for structuring the web page content.
- **CSS:** Utilized for styling the HTML elements and enhancing visual presentation.
- **JavaScript:** Employed for implementing interactivity, data manipulation, and dynamic content generation.

## Usage

To run this coding test locally, simply clone the repository and open the `index.html` file in a web browser. Ensure that you have a modern web browser that supports HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Acknowledgments

This coding test was completed as part of the requirements for the Sedibelo Technology front-end developer position. Special thanks to Sedibelo Technology for providing this opportunity to demonstrate skills and expertise in front-end web development.
