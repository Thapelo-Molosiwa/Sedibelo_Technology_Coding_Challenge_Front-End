# Dynamic Bar Graph

This project demonstrates the creation of a dynamic bar graph using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The bar graph represents the number of installs over different months.

## Files Included

- **index.html**: Contains the HTML structure of the web page.
- **style.css**: Contains the CSS styles for styling the web page and the bar graph.
- **script.js**: Contains the JavaScript code to fetch data and draw the bar graph.
- **barGraph.json**: Contains the data for the bar graph.

## Getting Started

To view the dynamic bar graph:
1. Download or clone the repository.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.

## Description

The bar graph is created dynamically using D3.js library for data visualization. It fetches data from the `barGraph.json` file and draws the bar graph accordingly.

## Implementation Details

- The `script.js` file fetches data from the `barGraph.json` file using the Fetch API.
- The fetched data is then used to dynamically draw the bar graph using D3.js library.
- The CSS file (`style.css`) provides styling for the web page and the bar graph, including colors, layout, and responsiveness.
- The HTML file (`index.html`) contains the structure of the web page, including a container for the bar graph and references to CSS and JavaScript files.

## Dependencies

- D3.js library (`https://d3js.org/d3.v7.min.js`) is used for data visualization.
- The project relies on standard HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
